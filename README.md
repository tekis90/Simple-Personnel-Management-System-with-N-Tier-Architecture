# Simple-Personnel-Management-System-with-N-Tier-Architecture

Multi-Layered Architecture Personnel Management System
This project is designed as a Personnel Management System based on the principles of multi-layered architecture in software development. This architecture separates the functional parts of the application, creating a more modular and scalable structure. The system allows users to easily perform operations such as listing, adding, updating, and deleting personnel information.

Project Objectives
Modularity: Each layer performs only the tasks for which it is responsible.
Ease of Maintenance: The separation between layers simplifies the maintenance and development of the software.
Reusability: The business logic and data access layers are designed to be reusable in other projects.
Architectural Layers
Entity Layer:

Contains classes that represent the tables in the database.
For example, the EntityPerson class includes personnel details such as ID, name, surname, city, job, and salary.
Data Access Layer (DAL):

Handles database access and operations.
Abstracts operations such as data retrieval (SELECT), insertion (INSERT), updating (UPDATE), and deletion (DELETE).
Logic Layer:

Contains business rules and validation logic.
Ensures the validity of data sent to the database or presented to the user.
UI Layer:

Provides the interface for users to interact with the system.
Visualizes the data and forwards user inputs to other layers.
Key Features
Validation Mechanism: Ensures input data complies with business rules, preventing incorrect or incomplete entries.
Error Handling: Manages database operation errors to ensure system stability.
Modularity: Each component can be developed and tested independently due to the layered architecture.
Database Independence: Data access operations are abstracted, allowing for easy migration to different database systems.
Benefits of the Project
Flexibility and organization in software development processes.
A more readable, maintainable, and scalable software architecture.
Improved reliability by separating business rules and data access operations.
This multi-layered architecture provides an efficient solution, particularly for medium and large-scale projects, offering significant advantages to both software developers and end-users.
